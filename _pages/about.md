I wanted to change the theme of my blog, but didn't want to mess up the SEO of existing articles or break any references used to my articles, therefore I'll keep it as a separate blog and if I have time I'll migrate my previous articles to this one.

Anyway, I'm currently working as a Security Researcher, focusing on threat research, malware analysis, developing static and behavioural anti-malware signatures for AV and EDR. 
My past experience is as Security Analyst where I was involved in incident response, digital forensics and security monitoring. Also performed penetration tests on occasion.  

My interests are in blue team activities like malware analysis, digital forensics, threat research, although sometimes I also find interest in offensive research.  

In my blog I write down the things I learn, because when you try to explain something you can see if you truly understand it.  

I greatly appreciate any feedback about the articles :)
